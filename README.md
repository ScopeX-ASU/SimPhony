## Introduction

**SimPhony** aims to provide researchers and engineers with a powerful tool for simulating and analyzing photonic architectures. By supporting various dataflow switching methods and offering extensive device libraries, SimPhony enables detailed performance evaluations and optimizations of photonic systems.

In **SimPhony**, users can define the basic building blocks and reuse them in photonic core designs. If a complete netlist is provided, **SimPhony** is capable of calculating area in a layout-aware manner. Users can always define a customized function for area calculation.

**SimPhony** realizes photonic domain parallelism during latency and energy calculation; users may define it in the configuration.

**SimPhony** is also capable of calculating device energy in a data-dependent manner. (Warning: this can only be realized when using both [TorchONN](https://github.com/JeremieMelo/pytorch-onn) and "PowerCalculator" located in ```models/layers/utils```) Users can always define a customized function for any arbitrary energy calculation.

Case Study: Dynamic Array-style Tensor Cores [TeMPO](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.07393v1).

We first define the architecture parameters: **R** tiles, each containing **C** cores, with **H** $\times$ **W** dot-product nodes per core performing parallel computations. Then, we define the structure of the minimum building block, i.e., the dot-product unit, denoted as a node. A node netlist is used to describe the 6-device circuit topology using directed 2-pin nets to represent the waveguide connections and signal flow. 

To efficiently span the multi-
core architecture without manually detailing every connection, we
define scaling rules applied to each node and describe inter-node
connections. There are **RCHW** total nodes for parallel dot-product. As the output of C cores in a tile are in-situ accumulated, integrators/ADCs can be shared and thus scaled by **CHW** . MZM group A encodes one matrix operand and can be broadcast to R tiles. Thus, the input encoders, i.e., DAC A and MZM A, are scaled by **RH**. 
These scaling rules are expressed as customizable symbolic expressions in circuit description files, enabling user-defined reuse styles to suit specific designs.

In this folder, we provide [Lightning Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19533), a multi-wavelength version of the [TeMPO](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.07393v1) architecture for users to study and validate. You may run the example in the ```unitest``` folders to learn how each module can be used.
